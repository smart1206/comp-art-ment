## <a name="thankyous"></a>Thank Yous
Making this app was delightful and challenging.  It was made better by the support of people in the cohort both students, instructors, and IAs.  I especially want to thank Ashley for her countless hours of battling stubborn code; she is a boss, hire her! For more info here is her [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ashley-sands/) #Firenationqueen, .  I also want to thank my friend Zach who is always there in person and in discord to answer questions and offer ideas, I learn new things from you daily, your mind is beautiful.  Last but not least I want to thank my amazing artist friend Christin Smolinski Lee for giving me permission to use her amazing artwork and cute face in one of my main profiles. Check out her amazing [artist page](https://christinsmolinski.carrd.co/#). 
## The End :)
